# ralgo

This library contains Rust implementations of some well-known algorithms and data structures. Each algorithm is accompained with it's own readme containing a brief review of the theory behind it. The goal of this project is to provide a reference covering some basic algorithms and data structures - theory as well as implementation. The library is currently work-in-progress.

## Contents

The following algorithms and data structures are going to be covered (classification is somewhat borrowed from Robert Segdewick and Kevin Wayne's "Algorithms, 4th edition"):

- Sorting:
    * Mergesort;
    * Quicksort;
    * Heapsort;
    * Countsort;
- Searching:
    * Heap (aka Priority Queue);
    * Red-Black binary search tree;
    * AVL binary search tree;
    * Hash table with separate chaining collision resolution strategy;
    * Hash table with linear probing collision resolution strategy;
- Graphs:
    * Union-Find (aka Disjoint Set Union);
    * Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm;
    * Kruskal's minimum spanning tree algorithm;
    * Prim's minimum spanning tree algorithm;
    * Ford-Fulkerson masimum flow algorithm;
- Strings:
    * Least Significant Digit sorting (aka LSD sorting);
    * Most Significant Digit sorting (aka MSD sorting);
    * Three-way string quicksort;
    * Knuth-Morris-Pratt substring search;
    * Boyer-Moore substring search;
    * Rabin-Karp substring search;
    * Ternary Search Trie;
